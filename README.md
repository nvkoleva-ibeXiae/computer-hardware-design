Computer Hardware Design Lab Reports, Fall 2019

Repository includes material from Fall 2019, in the form of lab reports. 

ðŸ’¾ Lab Report 1 exhibits and explores the problems associated with driving computer busses by examining the reflections in a 50-ohm coaxial transmission line, done using the Keysight Digital oscilliscope. 

ðŸ’¾ Lab Report 2 is an introduction to digital hardware design using a state machine. The system specifically uses a Richards Controller, a counter-based state machine implementation, that can be easily built from TTL chips or other common digital components. Large parts of the lab also focus on the construction and debugging of digital hardware, as well as the use of a logic analyzer as a debugging tool. 

ðŸ’¾ Lab Report 3 is a continuation of Lab Report 2 and focuses on digital hardware design using a state machine. The system once again uses a Richards Controller, a counter-based state machine implementation, that is then implemented in a Field Programmable Gate Array. This lab specifically focuses on the Altera FPGA hardware and its implementation with design tools.

ðŸ’¾ Lab Report 4 is an introduction to I/O interfacing. The objective is to design an interface that allows effective communication between a peripheral UART and a RAM circuit that stores 16 characters. The interface is fully built, tested, and debugged throughout the lab.

ðŸ’¾ Lastly, Lab Report 5 is a continuation of Lab Report 4 with the same objective. Instead of using a UART and RAM chips on a breadbord, however, the circuit implementation is built in Quartus II, connected to an optoisolator on a board, and connects through an FPGA to transmit and receive 16 characters.
